Project : ArthaWebApp

This project helps to compute average assignment rating for each student and/or subjects to measure  effectiveness of learning.


How to Use:

1) This is a web project, which need to run on tomcat server.

2) As soon as we run the application, Home page of Artha Education Institute will come up.

3) Three buttons(finding average of particular student, finding average of particular subject or 
   to display the entire data) are provided in the home page.
   
    a) If we select finding average of particular student button, 
       a new page will be opened, you need to enter the student name, and click submit.
       Then that particular student's average in all the subject will be displayed.

    b) If we select finding average of particular subject button, 
       a new page will be opened, you need to enter the subject name, and click submit.
       Then all students average in that particular subject will be displayed.
